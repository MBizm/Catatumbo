'''
This class defines some basic colors based on the perceived colors resulting from an WS2811 LED strip.
The neopixel driver does not allow an accurate mapping of RGB/HSV color values. Even small blue values will result in very bright result.

Available colors depend on the type of the neopixel LED strip and can be seen from the respective init-methods.
